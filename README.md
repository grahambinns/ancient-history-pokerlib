# Something to do with Poker, I guess

This was the beginnings of a library I was writing some seven years or so ago
as part of the early stages of an online startup. The project never went
anywhere (or else I left that project early on) but here's the code anyway.

Using the `Deck` class, you can create a 52-card deck, from which you can deal
cards.

That's pretty much it. I can't remember what everything in constants.py does,
and I'm pretty sure I cribbed it from somewhere, but I know not where.
